# Battlefront Overhaul Mod

## Overview

### Our mission:

The goal of this project is *not* to create a new game. The primary goals are to rebalance units and fix bugs in the stock maps.

The Second goal is to completely rewrite all of the stock missions in a way that is easy to read and make quick edits to. The [source code](https://github.com/toothpaste-main/battlefront-overhaul-mod/tree/main/data_BOM/Common/scripts/BOM) for many of them are available now!

The final goal is to update the look of the game with preexisting assets so that it is more aligned with the canon. In the end, the game should still feel and play the same. 

### Planned releases:
- ~~6 July 2024: v1.0-alpha~~
- ~~12 July 2024: v2.0-alpha~~
- ~~14 July 2024: v2.1-alpha~~
- 23 August 2024: v3.0-alpha
- October 2024: v1.0-beta
